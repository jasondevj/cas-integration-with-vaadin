########## CAS Integration with Vaadin ############
###################################################


This is a Spring-security wrapper for Vaadin. Using this Vaadin applications can use CAS to authenticate the user.
All cas filters are configured in the core module, Vaadin applications just need to have a cas.properties file with the
configurations and a spring-security.xml to set the filter URL and the datasource (could be a DB or just and XML).

See the Sample application on how to deploy.

To try out SSO try clicking on the 'do something' button on the sample application this will direct the user to CAS
if the user is not logged-in


NOTE :
JSP login also have been added for the sample application but that is just for demonstration
jsp login will not help for the SSO login. You can try jsp login by using '/jsp/login'
